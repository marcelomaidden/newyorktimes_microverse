                                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
                                with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and 
                                equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.

                                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have 
                                been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to 
                                begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space 
                                itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster 
                                than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.

                                If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole 
                                to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles 
                                and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, 
                                like spit in the ocean.

                                Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called

                                Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.

                            <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>

            <p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</p>

                <p>THE UNIVERSE  is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.</p>
             </div>
             <div>
                 <p>
                    NOT ENOUGH TIME  The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast distance from one side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.
                 </p>

                    DISTANT COFFEE  At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled.

             <div>
                 <p>
                    COFFEE EVERYWHERE  Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.

             <div>
                 <p>
                    STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME  There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even temperature
                 </p>

                    INFLATION  solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe

                    FLUCTUATION  Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.

             <div>
                 <p>
                    EXPANSION  Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.
