                            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
                            with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and 
                            equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.

                            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have 
                            been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to 
                            begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space 
                            itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster 
                            than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.

                            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole 
                            to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles 
                            and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, 
                            like spit in the ocean.
